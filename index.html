  <h2>History</h2>
  <h3>Pre-History</h3>
  <h4>Acoustic Guitars</h4>
  <p>The earliest guitars were created by cavemen by accident when using twine to carry a drum. 
  When the twine was plucked, the cavegirls went wild and the first <em>Groupies</em> were invented.
  <br /><br />In fact, several innovations were cemented in this early era, including:</p>        
  <ol>
    <li>Dodgy Managers</li>
    <li>Dubious "Contracts"</li>
    <li>Guitarist Ego</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Post-History</h3>
  <h4>Electric Guitars</h4>
  <p>Once the guitar was refined over the centuries, Thomas Edison could claim credit to electrify the
  instrument, unfortunately killing several of his lab assistants along the way. 
  It was only when Ronald Pickup came up with a coil of copper wire to translate the string vibation
  into an electric waveform that the instrument was safe to play.</p>
